# Absorption-Spectra-ADF

* when it comes to theoretical computations, absorption spectra is a must need. therefore, these scripts will give you a heads-up on your plots!
* we do have two different scripts (does the same thing 😆, but it easier this way!),
  1. _**intensity Vs energy (eV)**_
  2. _**intensity Vs wavelength (nm)**_

* The only important file is the _.csv_ file, which has the data needed for each setting.
* _**Absorption_spectra_intensity_vs_wavelength.ipynb**_ will provide as extra feature which you can enhance a certain range of your full spectra (you can use the same method in _**Absorption_spectra_intensity_vs_energy.ipynb**_ as well!).
  
* here is an example plot 📈 generated using, Absorption_spectra_intensity_vs_energy.ipynb,
